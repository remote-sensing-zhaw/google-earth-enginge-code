# Demo 3: html-script



Demonstrate doing math

```js
var myage_days = myage*365;

console.log("I am "+myage_days+" days old");
```

In the console, demonstrate checking the type with `typeof()`

```js
typeof(myage);
typeof(myname);
```

Now, demonstrate comments by adding comments to the code

```js
// I'm declaring my variables here:
var myage = 34;
var myage_days = myage*365;

console.log("I am "+myage_days+" days old");
```

Demonstrate creating arrays

```js
var myFriends = ["John","Peter", "Mary"];
```

In the console, demonstrate calling items from an array in the console. 
**Note** that the first value is index as `0`

```js
myFriends[0];
```

What if we want to store information on each friend, e.g. the age? 
Demonstrate this with a dictionary.

```js
var myFriends = {John: 23, Peter: 33, Mary: 40};
```

Show that indexing does not work with numbers in a dictionary
```js
myFriends[0];

// it works with string
myFriends["John"];

// or with a dot
myFriends.John;
```

Demonstrate functions. 

Question: what are functions good for?

```js
// write this function in the html file, 
// then run it in the console
function say_hello(){
    console.log("hello")
};
```

```js
// write this function in the html file, 
// and call it within the script
function say_hello(){
    console.log("hello")
};

say_hello();
```

The previous function did not take an input. 

Let's create a function that takes an input:

```js
// write this function in the html file, 
// then run it in the console
function say_something(what){
    console.log(what)
};
```
